    "quote": "An inch and a half thick of coconut milk/cassava root (yucca) deliciousness.  The CASSAVA cake had a small layer of sweetness on top and chewy smooth bottom layer.  Everyone who tried it from a newbie to an oldie enjoyed it.  My coworkers cherished every bite until it was all gone.  They're willing to drive the distance to pick up some more.  Highly recommend the cassava.  The Maja Blanca was quite delish as well with a blend of milk, sweetness and nutty taste from the corn kernels.  My parents requested seconds for Mother's Day.",
